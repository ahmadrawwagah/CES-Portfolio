# COMS3930-Portfolio

Hi, This is my portfolio for Creative Embedded Systems!! Below you can find some of the projects I have completed as a part of that course.


# ESP32 Valentines Art Installation
I created an art installation that consisted of an ESP32 in an envelope hanging from the ceiling

# Artistic Vision
I knew I wanted to theme my installation around Valentine's Day as we would be displaying our projects the day before Valentine's.
I decided that I would center my design on a quote I had seen online which reads "To be loved is to be changed" ~ some Twitter user.
I like this quote a lot and It fits with the theme of Valentine's. I wanted to have the text scroll past on the screen so I found
an example that does that. I also edited it to make it generative by adding a lot of randomness to the displayed text. The color
was chosen at random and the position was chosen at random. I also added a 30% chance that the text wouldn't be displayed and instead,
a stream of hearts would appear with random color and position as well. I also purposefully allowed for the text to appear on top of 
each other as I liked how chaotic it looked on the screen after it had been running for a while. The screen eventually resets itself
which ensures the text stays readable the entire time.
# Challenges
Some of the challenges I faced while making this project were the limited battery capacity and the open-ended nature of the assignment.
The limited battery size meant I needed to come up with a way to limit my power draw. I did this by dimming the backlight every 5 mins.
I also struggled to find inspiration for what to do for my project. I only came up with the idea while I was scrolling on Twitter and 
saw the quote.
# Video
